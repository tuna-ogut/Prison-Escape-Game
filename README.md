# Prison-Escape-Game

## Overview

This Unity project is a game featuring player and enemy interactions, patrolling enemies, collectables, and attack mechanics.

## Features

- Patrolling Enemies
- Combat System with animations and particle effects
- Collectables (Upgraders and Keys)
- Key-based Doors
- Level Management
- Collectibles

## Notes
- Any prefab that I changed are in the `Prefabs` folder under assets. Rest of the assets are under External Packages.
- Folder structure is minimal due to a limited number of assets. If the project became bigger further separation would be required.
- Scripts are not namespaced as each would only contain 1-2 scripts, making namespaces unnecessary.
